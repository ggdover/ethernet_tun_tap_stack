TODO:

* Fix or at least suppress "note:" warnings/notes from the compiler that says:
  note: the ABI of passing struct with a flexible array member has changed in GCC

* Can I setup the print functions/macros in utils.h so that 
  only the macro (print_raw, print_eth, print_arp, print_ipv4)
  can be called but not the underlying sub function (raw_print, 
  eth_print, arp_print, arp_ipv4_print) ??
